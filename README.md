# Gmailer    
A script to send mail at specific intervals of a code execution which is going to take a lot of time to execute. I use it to send mails to myself when the iterations of my Neural Network are complete and when I want to be intimated about accuracy at certain epochs. To use this, you need to allow less secure apps to access your gmail(sender) which you can do by going to below link.
